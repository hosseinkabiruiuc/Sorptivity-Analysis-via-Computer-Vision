✨System requirements✨

    Operating System: Compatible with systems that support Python and Jupyter notebooks.
    Python Version: Compatible with Python 3.x.
    Hardware Requirements: Requires a CUDA-capable GPU to ensure model training can leverage 
    GPU acceleration as indicated by the assertion torch.cuda.is_available().

✨Software Dependencies✨

    google-colab: For mounting Google Drive and notebook operations.
    PIL: For image manipulation.
    torch: Main library for neural network models and GPU computing.
    torchvision: For image transformations and dataset loaders.
    pytorch_lightning: For more structured and cleaner training loops.
    matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
    - **numpy**: For numerical operations.
    segmentation_models_pytorch: For pretrained segmentation models.
    plotly: For interactive visualizations.
    pandas: For data manipulation and reading/writing CSV files.
    re: For regular expression operations.
    pathlib: For system path operations.
    io: For handling IO operations.
    Other custom scripts (models, dataset_loader, evaluation, util, visualize) are used, 
    so ensure these are included in the system path or installation directory.
